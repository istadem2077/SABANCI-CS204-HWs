# Computer Science Homework Repository (C++)

## üìå Overview
This repository contains C++ code for various computer science homework assignments. The assignments cover fundamental and advanced topics in C++ programming, including data structures, memory management, and object-oriented programming.

## üìö Topics Covered
- **Introduction**: Overview of basic concepts, Visual C++ environment, preprocessor directives, compiler options, linker, libraries, debugging.
- **Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Templates, Templated Classes, and Functions**
- **Advanced Issues on Classes and Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Data Representation, Bitwise Operations**
- **Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Advanced Object-Oriented Design**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Programming with Threads**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This code is intended for educational purposes only. **Do not copy the code for direct submission as your own work.** Instead, use it as a reference to understand concepts and improve your programming skills. Academic dishonesty can have serious consequences.

## üîß Prerequisites
To compile and run the code, you may need:
- A C++ compiler (GCC/G++)
- Linux or Windows system. MacOS is discouraged as it(along with Clang) allows accessing deallocated memory, and getting GCC on MacOS is quirky and waste of time.
- An IDE or text editor (Visual Studio, CLion, VS Code, etc.)
- A basic understanding of C++

## üí° Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.
